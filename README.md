## Progress

### Report
_Note: a lot of this stuff can be taken from the proposal, it just needs to be polished. ([Link to proposal/report](https://www.overleaf.com/6829945714dwmwckxbbctz))_
- [X] outline
- [X] introduction
- [ ] computational overview
  - [ ] data fetching
  - [X] building the graph
  - [X] answering the questions (graph traversal algos)
  - [X] visualization
- [X] instructions for TA
- [ ] changes to original plan
- [ ] discussion
  - [ ] interpreting results
  - [ ] limitations/obstacles
  - [ ] further exploration/conculsion

### Code
- [X] BigQuery/data fetching
  - [X] basic functionality
  - [X] writing to CSV
  - [X] allowing user to specify params
    - [X] filter out transactions with value = 0 (Y/N)
    - [X] limit number of transactions (default = 1000)
    - [ ] ~~choose to have no sorting (this might result in a mess)~~
    - [X] change sorting order (default = dates DESC)
    - [X] unrelated: consider removing unnecessary columns from transactions.csv
- [X] building the graph (we're done this, right?)
- [X] graph traversal algos ~~(this probably won't involve much coding, networkx provides methods that help)~~
  - [X] are there any paths with length > 1? if so, what is the longest path?
  - [X] any cycles?
- [X] regression analysis?
- [X] visualization
  - [X] basic functionality
  - [X] size of nodes depends on Ether balance
  - [X] colour of nodes depends on number of connections
  - [X] display balance/acct. number when hovering over node
  - [X] display transaction value when hovering over edge
