CSC111 Final Project: Reconstructing the Ethereum Network Using Graph Data Structures in Python 

## Progress

### Report
- [X] outline
- [ ] introduction
- [ ] computational overview
  - [ ] data fetching
  - [ ] building the graph
  - [ ] answering the questions (graph traversal algos)
  - [ ] visualization
- [ ] instructions for TA
- [ ] changes to original plan
- [ ] discussion
  - [ ] interpreting results
  - [ ] limitations/obstacles
  - [ ] further exploration/conculsion

### Code
- [ ] BigQuery/data fetching
  - [X] basic functionality
  - [X] writing to CSV
  - [ ] allowing user to specify params
- [X] building the graph (we're done this, right?)
- [ ] graph traversal algos
- [ ] visualization
  - [X] basic functionality
  - [ ] size of nodes depends on Ether balance
  - [ ] colour of nodes depends on number of connections
  - [ ] display balance/acct. number when hovering over node
  - [ ] display transaction value when hovering over edge
  - [ ] experiment with other layouts? (maybe let the user specify)
- [ ] Dash app
  - [ ] basic functionality
  - [ ] extra features (_e.g._ user can choose how nodes are clustered using a dropdown?)
  - [ ] prettifying
